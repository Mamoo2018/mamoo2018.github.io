          <p>I have a Bachelors of Commerce from the Ryserson University and an Advanced Business Admin diploma from Humber. I had no experience in coding. Not the very slightest. After shuffling a few jobs I landed a position in 2016 at Trader Corporation which manages the autotrader.ca online marketplace and that is where things changed. I was slowly being exposed to HTML, CSS and Javascript in my everyday work. I developed an interest in it and decided to explorer the coding realm some more. I completed some online code classes and started to enroll in college classes focused on a specific language, but that wasn't enough. I wanted more. Fast forward two and a half years later and I am enrolled in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp program.
                    
            In my spare time &#123if I have any&#125 I like to spend time with my family. I also enjoy watching sports. Football, basketball and baseball are among my top favourites.</p>
